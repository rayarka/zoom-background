# Create a (simple) customized zoom video background with your logo

## What you'll need:
1. Download the video you wish to use (mp4 preferably). *A potential improvement would be to integrate the youtube_dl or another similar module and allow the user to select a video based on url*
2. Download the picture you wish to use (png preferrably)
3. Clone this repo
4. Run **pip install -r requirements.txt** to download the moviepy module
5. Run **zoom_bkgrnd_logo.py**
6. Use the GUI to choose your video file
7. Use the GUI to choose your logo
8. Use the GUI to choose a save location
9. Patience (the longer the video, the more time it will take) *A potential improvment would be to allow the user to choose segments of the video to use as a background or to allow them to loop/reverse the video*
10. The video should be ready to use!

*Other possible improvements include:*
- making it a web app
- allowing the user to select the location of the logo
- allowing the user to use video logos instead of simple picture logos
- enabling addition of multiple logos
